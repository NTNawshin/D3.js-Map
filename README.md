This interactive map was created for Interactive Cartography and Geovisualization (GEOG 575) course at UW-Madison. The project required integrating five attributes across fifteen enumerated areas into a cohesive map and coordinated chart using D3.js. This visualization shows five socio-economic attributes —Happiness Index, GRP, Unemployment Rate, Life Expectancy, and Crime Rate- across Germany’s sixteen states. 
The map uses visual hierarchy through thoughtful color choices: red for metrics like crime rate and unemployment, and green for positive indicators such as happiness, GRP and life expectancy. The design implements interactive affordances—such as highlighting and coordinated updates between the map and chart. Debugging and fine-tuning interactivity was done to conform with user-centered design principles, such as feedback, and discoverability.
